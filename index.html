        <p>Hackers learn in different ways, like online tutorials, forums, and networking with other hackers. 
            While formal education is helpful, 
            hands-on experience from projects is key to enhancing their skills. 
            This practical learning helps them solve real-world problems and become 
            better at troubleshooting.</p>

                <p>Ethical hackers need a variety of technical skills. 
                    They need to be proficient in programming languages such as Python, C/C++, Java,
                     and JavaScript.
                     But they also need to understand network protocols and architecture and identify 
                     vulnerabilities. 
                    Advanced computer knowledge is also essential.</p>
